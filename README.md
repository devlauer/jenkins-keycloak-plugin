**(applies only to the older plugin version)**

**Usage of the newer version:**

#### Step 1 : Create a keycloak client in a realm

Lets call the realm **'ci'** and the client **'jenkins'**

Jenkins is running on port **8080**

Create the client accordingly

Also make sure sample users are also created, in this case I have
created 'devlauer'.

#### Step 2 : Copy the keycloak.json
